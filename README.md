# Breakout
 
This is a game that I have created by following a tutorial by [tantan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ9YTY7ZgsI).

This was mainly to get me creating something fun while starting to understand the basic syntax and features of the Rust programming language. On top of the tutorial, I have added some extra powerups and I plan to add the possibility of loading levels from files.
